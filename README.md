## Download 
For downloading use 
       `git clone https://github.com/ShaonMajumder/simple_K_Nearest_Neighbors.git` 
## Explanations
1. Determine the eucledean distances between train rows and test single row
2. Store the distances, with their respective label in pairs ( [distance,label] )
3. Rearrange the pairs in ascending order by their distances
4. Take the first k numbers pairs and check the most appeared label in pairs. That is the Resultant label or class.
